# CNN-model-using-SVHN-dataset
The goal of this study is to train a CNN to classify photographs of numbers using the Street View House Numbers (SVHN) dataset. Because the dataset is real-world in nature, it poses special obstacles, such as differences in illumination, scale, and digit rotation. The objective is to develop a model that, in spite of these difficulties, correctly identifies digits. Numerous applications, like automated number plate recognition, postal address scanning, and digit categorization in mobile applications, can benefit from the implementation of such a system. Through the creation of a reliable CNN model that can handle digit categorization in the real world, the project will assist participants in putting computer vision theory into practice.
